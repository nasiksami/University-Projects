This project was done by me and my group mates for the human computer interaction course during my 3rd semseter.
In this project we selected a website and then detected all the glitches and usability lackings in it. We did prototyping 
in different format and came up with our improvised solution for the website afer conducting several interviews and other 
elicitation techniques were used.

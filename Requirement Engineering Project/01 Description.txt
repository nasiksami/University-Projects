This course project was based on the CPRE examination syllabus. The project is basically
accumulation of 4 assignments on requirements elicitation, documentation, management and requirements modelling.
Our project title was about IIUM Course Repository Management System. It proposed to solve one of the most tiring
issue faced by our lecturers, in order to maintain the files in the course repository. Currently they had to use 
cloud platform as well as the hard copies.Which were hard to handle.For our system, we took interview from the real 
life stakeholders and also did other elicitation techniques. We modelled out system in various diagrams form different 
perspectives. We documented by using proper template and notations. Finally we used JIRA to manage our system.

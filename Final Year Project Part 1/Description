This is a research-based project using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Keeping the Sustainable Development Goals declared by the United Nations, we started to this project.
We are looking for the optimal solution for the waste image classification. So far we have tried CNN, SVM, Random Forest and Decision Tree Algorithms to find the most suitable 
one for providing the optimal solution.Now we are working on basically the deep learning part by using different architectures of Neural Networks. Soon we will deploy the end 
product and result of our project.

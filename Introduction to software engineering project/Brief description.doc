This project was done by me and my group mates during my first semester about an abstract online book rental system. Here is the overview of the project-
Online Islamic books rental system – This system is developed to help people to find Islamic books per their choices. Since different people have different book preferences, 
we perform careful feature selection to take advantage of the information reflected in the system user’s reviews. Furthermore, since renting is frequently a communal activity,
we generated recommendations not just for an individual user, but also for a group of users.  This system needs to consider the information of all individuals in a group and 
recommend books that satisfy the group of users according to some criterion.
